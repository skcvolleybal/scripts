# Scripts

## Usage
1. Rename env.json.example to env.json
2. Place the env.json one level above your root directory (usually called public_html or htdocs). We don't want env.json to be accessible from the web so it has to be one level above root. 
3. Edit the env.json and configure according to needs.
